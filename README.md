Hi! I'm Nitanshu â€” a third-year computer science student who loves building things that actually work.

Right now, I'm focused on exploring **Java**, **Python**, and **AWS** by creating real-world apps, whether it's a GUI-based expense tracker or terminal tools to automate cloud stuff.

I believe in learning by doing, even if itâ€™s messy at first. If I can turn an idea into a working project, thatâ€™s a win.

- **Languages**: C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS
- **Cloud Tools**: AWS (EC2, IAM, Lambda, S3, SNS), AWS CLI
- **Core Concepts**: OOP, Multithreading, File I/O, Collections
